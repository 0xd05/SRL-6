PRE-RELEASE TODO's:

- MAKE IT COMPILE!

- Make sure all constants are UPPERCASE
- Keep lines less than 80 characters long except function/procedure declarations (function a: boolean)

- Documentation
	- Update all documentation
	- All headers should have examples, credits, and modified dates.
	- All constants, types, and vars should be documented. 
	- See amount.simba for examples of documenation
	- Try to make sure docs compile before committing them

        - Files that still need to be done
                - all antirandom files
                - files in lib/skills/
                - progressreports.simba

- Functions to fix
        - GetChatBoxText


- Clean up files
	- Largely, we need to remove unecessary functions. (one liners etc)
        - see http://villavu.com/forum/showthread.php?p=814118#post814118
        - Merge all the "Wait" methods with the the non-wait methods 
        - reorganize login.simba

- Remove ``string-cases'', replace with constants (and document :))

- Fix Random Solvers


POST-RELEASE TODO's:

- Implement Hobbit's antiban system.

- Implement Luff's custom waiting settings, keyboard settings, all that jazz
	- Perhaps use an extension for all of these settings and read from a file? Would need to be fast.
	- Loading these into a ``dictionary'' of sorts would be a nice way to implement this. 

- Blacklists
