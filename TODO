Updated: 23 Jan 2011 -- Nava2

HIGH:

- Documentation
	- Update all documentation
	- All headers should have examples, credits, and modified dates.
	- All constants, types, and vars should be documented. 
	- See amount.simba for examples of documenation
	- Try to make sure docs compile before committing them

- Clean up files

- Remove ``string-cases'', replace with constants (and document :))

- Fix Random Solvers



MED:

- Implement Hobbit's antiban system.

- Implement Luff's custom waiting settings, keyboard settings, all that jazz
	- Perhaps use an extension for all of these settings and read from a file? Would need to be fast.
	- Loading these into a ``dictionary'' of sorts would be a nice way to implement this. 

- Correct SRL Stats issues
	- fixed in Stats v1.3 --- please confirm. 








LOW:

- API setup for implementing reflection alternatives over top of SRL if needed
	- Considering moving this to SRL6 when we do the complete restructure. -- Nava2
